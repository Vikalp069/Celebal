Authentication Techniques
Shared Key Authorization:

Uses the storage account name and key for access.
Suitable for admin access and development purposes.
Shared Access Signatures (SAS):

Provides temporary access to storage resources.
You can specify permissions and expiration times.
Azure Active Directory (Azure AD):

Uses Azure AD credentials to access storage resources.
Suitable for user-specific permissions and role-based access control.
Anonymous Access:

Publicly accessible blobs or containers.
No authentication required, based on container-level settings.
Testing Authentication Techniques
Shared Key Authorization
Get Storage Account Key:

In the Azure Portal, navigate to your storage account.
Under "Settings," select "Access keys" and copy one of the keys.
Test Access (using Azure CLI):

sh
Copy code
az storage blob upload --account-name <account_name> --account-key <account_key> --container-name <container_name> --name <blob_name> --file <file_path>
Shared Access Signatures (SAS)
Generate SAS Token:

In the Azure Portal, navigate to your storage account.
Under "Settings," select "Shared access signature."
Configure the permissions and expiration time, then generate and copy the SAS token.
Test Access (using URL):

Construct the blob URL with the SAS token.
sh
Copy code
https://<account_name>.blob.core.windows.net/<container_name>/<blob_name>?<sas_token>
Azure Active Directory (Azure AD)
Assign Roles:

In the Azure Portal, navigate to your storage account.
Under "Access control (IAM)," add a role assignment (e.g., Storage Blob Data Contributor) to a user or group.
Test Access (using Azure CLI):

sh
Copy code
az login
az storage blob upload --account-name <account_name> --container-name <container_name> --name <blob_name> --file <file_path>
Anonymous Access
Set Public Access Level:

In the Azure Portal, navigate to your storage account.
Go to the container and set its public access level to "Blob" or "Container."
Test Access:

Access the blob directly via its URL.
sh
Copy code
https://<account_name>.blob.core.windows.net/<container_name>/<blob_name>
