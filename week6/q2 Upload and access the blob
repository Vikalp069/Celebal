Upload a Blob
Navigate to Storage Account:

Go to the Azure Portal and open your storage account.
Create a Container:

In the left-hand menu, select "Containers."
Click "+ Container" to create a new container.
Provide a name for the container and set the access level (private, blob, or container).
Upload a Blob:

Open the newly created container.
Click on "Upload" to upload a file.
Select the file you want to upload from your local machine.
Click "Upload" to complete the process.
Access the Blob
Get Blob URL:

Navigate to the container where you uploaded the blob.
Click on the blob to open its properties.
Copy the URL from the "Blob URL" field.
Access Blob:

If the blob is publicly accessible (public access level set to blob or container), you can access it directly via the URL.
For private blobs, you need to use Azure Storage SDKs, REST API, or generate a shared access signature (SAS) token for secure access.
