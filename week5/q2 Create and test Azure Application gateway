Step 1: Create a Virtual Network
Navigate to the Azure Portal: Azure Portal
Create a Virtual Network:
Search for "Virtual Networks" in the top search bar.
Click "Create" and fill in the required details:
Name: myVNet
Region: Select a region close to you
Address space: 10.0.0.0/16
Create a subnet within the virtual network:
Name: mySubnet
Subnet address range: 10.0.0.0/24
Review and create the virtual network.
Step 2: Create Backend Servers (VMs)
Create Virtual Machines:

Navigate to "Virtual Machines" and click "Create."
Configure the VM:
Name: myVM1
Region: Same as your virtual network
Image: Ubuntu Server
Size: Standard_B1s
Authentication: SSH or password
In the Networking tab, choose the virtual network (myVNet) and subnet (mySubnet) created earlier.
Repeat to create myVM2.
Install Web Server on VMs:

SSH into each VM and install a web server (Apache or Nginx).
For Apache:
bash
Copy code
sudo apt update
sudo apt install apache2 -y
sudo ufw allow 'Apache'
echo "Welcome to myVM1" | sudo tee /var/www/html/index.html   # Run on myVM1
echo "Welcome to myVM2" | sudo tee /var/www/html/index.html   # Run on myVM2
For Nginx:
bash
Copy code
sudo apt update
sudo apt install nginx -y
sudo ufw allow 'Nginx HTTP'
echo "Welcome to myVM1" | sudo tee /var/www/html/index.html   # Run on myVM1
echo "Welcome to myVM2" | sudo tee /var/www/html/index.html   # Run on myVM2
Step 3: Create an Azure Application Gateway
Navigate to "Application Gateways":

Click "Create" and fill in the details:
Name: myAppGateway
Region: Same as your VNet
Tier: Standard_v2 or WAF_v2
Virtual Network: Select myVNet
Subnet: Create a new subnet (e.g., appGatewaySubnet with address range 10.0.1.0/24).
Configure Frontend IP:

Frontend IP address type: Public
Create a new public IP address (e.g., myAppGatewayIP).
Configure Backend Pools:

Add backend pool:
Name: myBackendPool
Add backend targets: Select the NICs of myVM1 and myVM2.
Configure Routing Rules:

Add routing rule:
Rule name: myRoutingRule
Listener: Create a new listener with a basic HTTP settings.
Backend target: Select myBackendPool.
HTTP settings: Create new settings (e.g., myHttpSettings) with the default settings.
Review and Create the Application Gateway.

Step 4: Test the Application Gateway
Get the Public IP of the Application Gateway:

Go to the Application Gateway resource.
Copy the public IP address from the Overview tab.
Test Access:

Open a web browser and navigate to the public IP address.
You should see the responses from your backend VMs ("Welcome to myVM1" and "Welcome to myVM2") in a round-robin manner, indicating that the Application Gateway is successfully distributing traffic between the VMs
